# OBSCURIA DARK THEME
This color theme is a visual expression inspired by the magnificent Obsidian, a volcanic stone that exudes mystery and elegance. Deep nuances of black, gray and subtle touches of dark blue are combined to create an engaging and sophisticated palette.

The intense black represents the solid base of Obsidian, emanating a feeling of mystery and serenity. Gray, in turn, adds nuances and depth, reflecting the natural variations found in the stone. The touch of dark blue evokes the mysterious energy often seen in Obsidian, adding an element of tranquility and serenity to the palette.

This color combination creates an environment that conveys elegance, sophistication and a touch of mystery.
